# To-do

## Fix collapsible.py
See TODO inside file.

## Determine relevant information and create relevant colour-coding functions
Observation Type would be interesting (Normal, Time-Critical, Rapid-Repsonse)
Also IPP (and proposal, so one could see it in the proposal)
Would then need some way to compare to non-scheduled requests?

## If possible, highlight selected observations
Make all other observations go slightly transparent when one is selected. Might
be quite difficult due to the way that the Gantt chart appears to be
jerry-rigged together (it appears to be a scatter plot, with one point at the
end of each box, and then the boxes drawn on top).
Maybe possible by redrawing (updating) the entire plot when one is selected?
Could change the colour scheme so that it includes one 'selected' key, which is
attributed to the selected value, and all other colours are reduced?

## Attempt to remove the Undo buttons from the Dash page
This might require some custom CSS

## Make the webpage open automatically upon running the `interactive.py` script
